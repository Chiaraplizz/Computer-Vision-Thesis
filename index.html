      <h2>1. Towards Robust Video-Question Answering</h2>
      <p class="requirements">Requirements: Python, PyTorch</p>
      <img src="images/vqa.png" alt="4D Scene Placeholder" class="placeholder">
      <p>
        The task of Video Question Answering (Video QA) involves analyzing a video in order to correctly answer a given natural-language question. Recent approaches primarily leverage large vision-language models (VLMs), which have shown strong capabilities in multimodal understanding [5].
      </p>
      <p>
        However, these models face notable limitations. A primary challenge lies in their difficulty in processing long videos due to input token constraints, which restrict the number of frames or segments that can be effectively analyzed [3]. As a result, important portions of the video may be omitted or compressed, leading to incomplete understanding. Beyond this, many models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics and subtle causal relationships between events, both of which are critical for tasks that require reasoning over sequences rather than isolated frames [2]. Their capacity for long-range reasoning is also limited, making it difficult to integrate information spread across distant segments of a video [3,5].
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this thesis is to address one of these limitations by developing methods that enhance the reasoning capabilities of Video QA systems, with the broader goal of building more robust models for real-world video understanding [1,4].

      <h2>2. Neurosymbolic Approaches for Video Understanding</h2>
      <p class="requirements">Requirements: Python, PyTorch</p>
      <img src="images/sg.png" alt="4D Scene Placeholder" class="placeholder">
      <p>
        An area of particular interest is the use of neuro-symbolic approaches for video understanding. Instead of reasoning directly over raw pixel data, the question is whether computer vision models, such as large vision-language models (VLMs), can operate effectively on higher-level, structured representations of videos. These representations might include scene graphs, captions, or other symbolic abstractions that capture semantic information from the video. For example, scene graphs are commonly used to model the relationships between entities and actions within a scene [2].
      </p>
      <p>
        By shifting the reasoning process from the video to these structured representations, models may achieve deeper temporal and causal understanding, greater interpretability, and improved scalability for long and complex videos [2].
      </p>
      <p>
        Building on prior research experience, where a previous M.Sc. thesis led to securing first place in the HD-EPIC challenge [1], this thesis investigates how neuro-symbolic approaches can be leveraged for more robust video understanding.

        Animals and humans exhibit learning abilities and understandings of the world that are far beyond the capabilities of current AI and machine learning (ML) systems. For instance, an adolescent can often learn to drive a car in about 20 hours of practice, and children acquire language with relatively little exposure. Moreover, most humans know how to act in many situations they have never explicitly encountered.
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast, current ML systems typically require vast amounts of training data to be reliable, so that even rare combinations of situations are encountered frequently during training [2].
      </p>
      <p>
        One explanation for this gap lies in the ability of humans and many animals to build world models, i.e., internal representations of how the world works. World models are crucial for tasks such as action prediction, task planning, robotic manipulation, and humanâ€“AI interaction [2]. They provide structured abstractions that enable predictive reasoning and planning, rather than passively processing inputs. Such models allow an agent to anticipate future states, reason about causal dependencies, and support decision-making [1,3].
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond perception, world models form the foundation for higher-level cognitive abilities. They can simulate alternative futures, evaluate potential outcomes, and guide planning in dynamic environments [2,4]. Recent works in video understanding have begun to explore this direction, developing systems that leverage predictive modeling and structured abstractions for planning and reasoning [5,6].
      </p>
      <p>
        Following this line of research, this thesis aims to investigate world models in the context of video understanding, with the goal of assessing their strengths, limitations, and implications for computer vision tasks.

        This thesis investigates a method for 4D scene understanding by encoding the dynamic visual content of 2D videos into a spatially structured 3D representation. Inspired by Language Embedded Radiance Fields (LERF) [1], which ground language embeddings into 3D to enable open-ended queries over static scenes, the core idea is to augment volumetric scene representations with embedded descriptors that capture not only geometric and appearance information, but also temporally localized cues derived from the evolving video stream [2].
      </p>
      <p>
        As the camera moves through the environment, frame-level visual features, such as motion patterns, object interactions, or temporal appearance changes, are projected into the 3D space, forming a dense, time-aware embedding field [2,3]. This enables the system to associate dynamic events with specific spatial regions in the scene, effectively grounding temporal context in 3D.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is a scene representation that supports spatio-temporal reasoning, such as identifying where certain actions occurred or how objects moved over time [3]. This work opens the door to applications in video-driven scene reconstruction, robotic memory, and embodied perception, where understanding what happened, where, and when is critical [2,3].

        Visual information in the brain is processed across multiple interconnected areas, arranged in a hierarchical organization somewhat reminiscent of deep neural networks. This cascade of processing enables sophisticated computations, with invariant object recognition as a striking example [1]: the ability to recognize objects regardless of changes in position, scale, orientation, or lighting. While the outcome of this system is clear, the mechanisms that produce it are not understood. In particular, the specific roles of different brain areas and the transformations of information as it passes from one stage to the next remain unresolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Newly developed recording techniques, such as electrophysiology and calcium imaging, allow researchers to measure neural activity at an unprecedented temporal and spatial scale [2]. However, while these methods reveal where and when activity occurs, approaches to interpret their results are still limited and remain an active area of research. In particular, they provide limited insight into what specific stimulus features drive the observed neural responses, and how these representations change across different brain areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in computer vision, provide new opportunities to bridge the gap between artificial visual systems and biological vision. This thesis proposes to use deep computer vision models to investigate the features and image characteristics that elicit responses in specific brain regions. Interpretability techniques, such as saliency maps, feature visualization, or language, will be applied to identify common properties of stimuli that consistently activate particular cortical areas [3,4].

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This thesis is slightly easier, as dataset and problem formulation are already defined. Still, good solutions for existing problems might be found.</p>
      <img src="images/challenges.png" alt="4D Scene Placeholder" class="placeholder">
      <p>
        Large-scale benchmarks such as Ego4D [1] and Ego-Exo4D [2] play a pivotal role in advancing applied AI for computer vision. They provide well-structured challenges with standardized metrics, reproducible baselines, and clear evaluation protocols, ensuring that research is conducted within a rigorous and transparent framework. Moreover, their strong international visibility, often highlighted through dedicated leaderboards and recognition at top-tier conferences, makes them a valuable platform for impactful contributions.
      </p>
      <p>
        One promising direction for this thesis is to tackle one of these benchmark challenges with a novel approach. Potential avenues include episodic memory, action anticipation, or social and object interaction reasoning, all of which remain open problems for current video understanding systems. These tasks directly address fundamental limitations in temporal reasoning, causal inference, and long-term context retention. Advancing solutions in any of these areas would not only push the state of the art on benchmark datasets but also contribute to building more robust, generalizable video understanding systems for real-world applications.
